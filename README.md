# libft

This project is my very first project as a student at 42.
I needed to recode a few functions from the C standard library as well as some other utility functions that I used throughout my entire curriculum.

This project helped me learn how to read the manual for each function. It's also good practice in C.

There are many operations on strings and memory management (using malloc).

This is a great project for beginners in C.
